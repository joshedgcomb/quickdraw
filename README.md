QuickDraw
=========

QuickDraw is an iPad app which was created by myself (Josh Edgcomb), John Verticchio, and Mimee Xu as a final project for our Software Development class. The app revolves around drawing on a canvas with your finger and attempting to match pre-rendered shapes as quickly and as accurately as you can.
